This directory holds the source files for MIT-licensed fmt libary (version 7.1.3)
retrieved from https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/archive/7.1.3.tar.gz

Note: Axom adds a custom header file ('fmt.hpp') to simplify usage of fmt configured as a header only library.
This can be included in source files as follows:

   #include "umpire/fmt.hpp"
