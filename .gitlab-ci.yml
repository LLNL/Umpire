# General GitLab pipelines configurations for supercomputers and Linux clusters
# at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).
#
# This entire pipeline is LLNL-specific
# #############################################################################

# We define the following GitLab pipeline variables:
#
# GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY:
# Tells Gitlab to recursively update the submodules when cloning umpire
#
# UMPIRE_ALLOC_NAME:
# On LLNL's quartz, this pipeline creates only one allocation shared among jobs
# in order to save time and resources. This allocation has to be uniquely named
# so that we are sure to retrieve it.
#
# BUILD_ROOT:
# The path to the shared resources between all jobs. The BUILD_ROOT is unique to
# the pipeline, preventing any form of concurrency with other pipelines. This
# also means that the BUILD_ROOT directory will never be cleaned.
# TODO: add a clean-up mechanism

variables:
  GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY: recursive
  UMPIRE_ALLOC_NAME: umpire_ci_${CI_PIPELINE_ID}
  BUILD_ROOT: ${CI_BUILDS_DIR}/umpire_${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}_${CI_PIPELINE_ID}

# Normally, stages are blocking in Gitlab. However, using the keyword "needs" we
# can express dependencies between job that break the ordering of stages, in
# favor of a DAG.
# In practice q_*, l_* and b_* stages are independently run as soon as start is
# complete.
stages:
  - start
  - q_allocate_resources
  - q_build
  - q_test
  - q_release_resources
  - l_build_and_test
  - b_build_and_test

# The start job is actually a dumb one, which serves as a reference to start
# q_allocate_resources, l_build_and_test and b_build_and_test simultaneously.
# Note: "GIT_STRATEGY: none" tells GitLab not to clone umpire for this job.

# jobs will share this through a template mechanism.

# These are also templates (.name) that define project specific build commands.
# If an allocation exist with the name defined in this pipeline, the job will
# use it (slurm specific).
