## [Develop Branch]

### Added

- Spack environment files for developer builds.

- Created 'ENABLE_INACCESSIBILITY_TESTS' cmake flag for explicitly checking that if an allocator
  is deemed inaccessible by the is_accessible function, it indeed can not be accessed/used.

- Documentation on allocator (in)accessibility as well as getAllocator usage.

- Updated Umpire::Allocator 'deallocate' documentation brief on handling
  deallocations on nullptr.

- Benchmark that overlooks overhead of malloc calls with No-Op memory resource.

- Added a data race check with Thread Sanitizer for the Gitlab CI test

- Created 'ENABLE_DEVELOPER_BENCHMARKS' cmake flag to enable benchmarks that are meant for
  internal Umpire development only (e.g. No-Op benchmark). Now 'ENABLE_BENCHMARKS' only enables
  BLT support for GoogleBenchmark.

- Added version macros to C API, and added version functions to C and FORTRAN APIs.

- Benchmark that measures the performance of different allocator vendor types across
  various allocation sizes.

- Benchmark that measures the performance of different memory pools

- Added a Release function to FixedPool and corresponding gtest in strategy_tests

- Install thirdparty exports in CMake configuration file

- UM-837 - Replay will now display high water mark statistics per allocator.

- Clean-up stage and build prefix for Gitlab CI script that will help us avoid
  disk quota problems.

- Added a benchmark that measures the performance of FixedPool across two allocation sizes.

- Added (de)registerAllocation to C/FORTRAN API.

- Added HPCToolKit page (with some Hatchet instructions) to ReadTheDocs Developer Guide.

- In Gitlab CI, upload junit reports for corona and lassen.

- Initial support for IPC Shared Memory via a "SHARED" resource allocator. IPC
  Shared memory is initially available on the Host resource and will default
  to the value of `ENABLE_MPI`.

- get_communicator_for_allocator to get an MPI Communicator for the scope of a shared allocator.

- Allocator::getStrategyName() to get name of the strategy used.

- Added lifespan timing info for no-op benchmark.

- Added `getActualHighwatermark` to all pool strategies, returns the high water
  value of `getActualSize`.

- `umpire::mark_event()` to mark an event during Umpire lifecycle

- Asynchronous memset and reallocate operations for CUDA and HIP.

- Added support for named allocations.

### Changed

- Organized configuration options in config.hpp.in in alphabetical order.

- Size Limiter example now has a try-catch statement to handle exception.

- Doubled timeout from 15 to 30 minutes for CI tests to build and run.

- Uberenv is now used as a submodule.

- CI on Gitlab does not require a python environment anymore.

- BLT submodule updated to v0.4.1.

- Quartz is no longer used for gitlab CI tests. Instead, those tests are
  now run on Ruby.

- Renamed'ENABLE_TESTS', 'ENABLE_EXAMPLES' and 'ENABLE_DOCS' to
  'UMPIRE_ENABLE_TESTS', 'UMPIRE_ENABLE_EXAMPLES' and 'UMPIRE_ENABLE_DOCS' and
  made those options dependant on the corresponding BLT options.

- Use CMake 3.18.0 in CI

- Replay testing disabled during HIP builds with `ENABLE_TOOLS`=On

- `DynamicPoolMap` marked deprecated. `QuickPool` should be used instead.

- Changed most internal and test uses of DynamicPoolMap to QuickPool.

- Reorganized the way that the no-op benchmark is structured to match the
  pool benchmarks.

- Formatting changed to 120 col, and added CI check to ensure style is applied.

- Update camp to latest commit.

- Use CMakeCachedPackage in uberenv.

- Refactored pool coalesce heuristic API to return either 0 or the minimum
  pool size to allocate when a coalesce is to be performed.  No functional
  change yet.

- Turn documentation off by default.

- All asynchronous operations now return a camp::resources::EventProxy to avoid
  the overhead of creating Events when they are unused.

- Removed CI jobs that were allowed to fail.

### Removed

- Removed extraneous function definition in HipDeviceMemoryResource.

- Removed all internal tracking, allocations are only tracked at the Allocator level.

- Removed the temporary fix for the HIP + fortran linker error (blt has been
  updated instead).

- Doxygen from Sphinx to fix auto documentation generation bug.

- DynamicPool and DynamicPoolMap removed from replay tests since they share the
  same signature as QuickPool.

- Removed replay of internal address_map operations.

### Fixed

- Fix incorrect accounting for m_current_bytes in DynamicPoolMap, this addresses an
  issue that would mean the pool would never coalesce automatically.

- Added ENABLE_ASAN (default=Off) for guarding address sanitization check to
  address compilation problems on some configurations.

- Fixed ranges used in the vendor allocator benchmark when HIP is enabled given
  that hipMalloc allocates on 4k aligned pages.

  `const std::string&` instead of a copy of the string.

- Fixed cmake warning for HIP+tools builds

- Export external camp_DIR if one is provided when building Umpire, and check
  both camp_DIR and camp_DIR/lib/cmake/camp when looking for package.

AllocationRecord::AllocationMap::findRecord causing it to incorrectly report
offset of `ptr+size_of_allocation` as found.

## [0.3.4] - 2019-06-06

### Fixed

- Bug AllocationRecord::AllocationMap::findRecord causing it to miss finding
allocations that were zero bytes in length.

## [0.3.3] - 2019-04-11

### Added

- NUMA strategy (umpire::strategy::NumaPolicy) that allows allocating memory
an specific NUMA nodes.

- Implemented << for Allocator, so that it can be printed directly.

- Update getAllocator methods to print list of available Allocators if the
requested Allocator cannot be found.

- Replay now captures coalesce operations from strategy::DynamicPool so that
these can be replayed.

- The replay tool can produce an output file that can be used to verify the
replayed events are correct.

- Cookbook example for creating a pool in pinned memory using FORTRAN.

- GitHub workflow to check for CHANGELOG updates.

- Ability to print allocation records that only match a predicate,
`print_allocator_records()` to get all records from a specific
allocator, and a cookbook recipe to do that.

- Dockerfile for multi-stage builds. Supports building Umpire with GCC, Clang,
and CUDA.

- GitHub action to run Clang static analysis.

allocation records for a specific allocator, and a method to calculate the
relative fragmentation.

### Changed

- Umpire now builds as a single library, libumpire.a or libumpire.so, rather
than having one library per source subdirectory.

- Removed shared_ptr usage entirely. Ownership of objects was never "shared"
and the smart pointers added unecessary overhead.

- Moved CHANGELOG to CHANGELOG.md.

### Removed

- The 'coalesce' method was removed from ResourceManager and now must be
accessed directory. examples/cookbook/recipe_coalesce_pool.cpp shows how to do
this.

### Fixed

- Bug in ResourceManager::copy/memset when given a pointer offset into an
allocation.

- Memory leak in judyL2Array.

- While replay already was recording release operations, the tool was not
actually replaying them.  A fix was implemented so that the replay tool will
now also replay any captured release operations.

- `make docs` used to fail, because the build was setup for Read the Docs. A fix
was implemented so Doxygen and Sphinx can be run locally, for instance to test
out new cookbooks.

- REPLAY previously recorded some operations with multiple print statements
causing REPLAY output from MPI runs to become mixed between multiple ranks.
REPLAY has been modified to output each operation onto a single line.
