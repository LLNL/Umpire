Umpire Cookbook
===============

This section provides a set of recipes that show you how to accomplish specific
tasks using Umpire. The main focus is things that can be done by composing
different parts of Umpire to achieve a particular use case.

Examples include being able to grow and shrink a pool, constructing Allocators
that have introspection disabled for improved performance, and applying CUDA
"memory advise" to all the allocations in a particular pool.
