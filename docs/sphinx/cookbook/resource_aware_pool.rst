Creating a Resource Aware Pool
=============================

This recipe describes how to create and use an Umpire ``ResourceAwarePool``. This pool is somewhat advanced
so we also provide a bit of background on Camp resources which are used to track resources and events.

Camp Resources
--------------

Umpire uses `Camp <https://github.com/LLNL/camp>`_ resources to keep track of "streams of execution". A single "stream of execution" 
on the device corresponds to a single Camp device resource (e.g. a single cuda stream). 
Similarly, when we are executing on the host, this
corresponds to a separate "stream of execution" and therefore a separate Camp host resource. 

Typically, we deal with multiple Camp resources. This includes a single resource for the host and 
one or more for the device, depending on how many (cuda, hip, etc.) streams we have in use. 
While we can have multiple camp resources for the device (e.g. multiple cuda streams), 
we can only have one resource for the host because the host only has one stream of execution. 
Since we are dealing with Camp resources, we call this pool strategy the ``ResourceAwarePool``.

Generic vs. Specific Camp Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Camp has two different types of Resources: generic and specific. A specific resource is created with:

.. code-block:: bash
   camp::resources::Cuda c1;

This will create a Cuda (specific) resource. With ``c1`` we can call different methods like ``get_platform()``
or ``get_stream()``. Parts of Umpire such as the Operations use these camp methods under the hood. On the
other hand, a generic resource is created with:

.. code-block:: bash
   camp::resources::Resource r{c1};

This way of creating a generic resource uses the specific resource created above, ``c1``, to constuct it.
We can also create a generic resource with:

.. code-blcok:: bash
   camp::resources::Resource r{camp::resources::Cuda()};

The ``ResourceAwarePool`` stores a generic camp resource, but since the compiler can implicitly convert a 
specific resource to a generic resource and vice versa, you can use either kind of resource 
with the ``ResourceAwarePool`` methods. The catch is that only the specific resource (``c1``) has a
method like ``get_stream()`` which would be needed when launching kernels - so we will be using the
specific resource in the examples below.

Throughout the rest of this documentation page, we will use a "camp resource" to refer to a "stream of
execution". If the camp resource is on the device, then we are referring to a device stream such 
as a cuda stream or hip stream.

Using a Single Resource
-----------------------

Umpire's strategies such as ``QuickPool`` and ``DynamicPoolList`` work very well
on the device when we are dealing with a single camp device resource. In the figure below, we have
the host resource which allocates memory (a\ :sub:`1`\), uses the memory in a kernel (k\ :sub:`1`\), then schedules
a deallocate (d\ :sub:`2`\). Then, the host immidiately reuses that memory for a different kernel (k\ :sub:`2`\).

.. image:: ./single_mem.png

In this scenario, there is no potential for a data race, since we are dealing with just one cuda stream
and kernels on a single stream execute sequentially. In other words, this scenario deals with only
one Camp device resource. In this type of scenario, there is no need for a ``ResourceAwarePool`` because
it would behave the same as your typical ``QuickPool``.

.. note:: A ``ResourceAwarePool`` with only one resource will behave the same as a ``QuickPool`` strategy.
   We don't advise using the ``ResourceAwarePool`` with only one resource since it will have the added
   overhead of the pending state (explained below). Instead, just use ``QuickPool`` if possible. 

Using Multiple Resources
------------------------

When dealing with multiple camp device resources, there is a possibility for a data race if we allocate, use, and 
schedule a deallocation on one stream and then try to reuse that memory immediately on another stream. 
The figure below depicts that scenario. Note that the overlap in the kernels corresponds to a potential
data race.

.. image:: ./multi-mem.png

Umpire's ``ResourceAwarePool`` is designed to avoid any potential data races by making the resources
"aware" of the memory used by another resource. If resource ``r2`` needs to allocate memory, but that
memory is potentially still being used by another resource, ``r1``,  then ``r2``  will use different 
memory instead. To do that, the ``ResourceAwarePool`` introduces a "pending" state.

As soon as ``r1`` schedules a deallocation, that memory is marked as ``_``pending``_`` and is only available 
for use by ``r1``. When the deallocation is complete, the ``_``pending``_`` marker is cleared, making that memory 
available for use by other resources. So when ``r2`` needs an allocation, it first checks to see if the memory 
is still ``_``pending``_``. If it is NOT ``_``pending``_``, it will reuse that memory, otherwise it will use a 
different piece of memory instead.

The figure below illustrates the 3 states of a ``ResourceAwarePool``: free, used, and pending.

Using a ResourceAwarePool
-------------------------

In this example, we will review how to use the :class:`umpire::strategy::ResourceAwarePool`
strategy. You can create a ``ResourceAwarePool`` with the following code:

.. code-block:: bash

   auto& rm = umpire::ResourceManager::getInstance();
   auto pool = rm.makeAllocator<umpire::strategy::ResourceAwarePool>("rap-pool", rm.getAllocator("UM"));
   
Next, you will want to create camp resources. We use these camp resources to track events
on the resource. Below is an example of creating a camp resource for two device streams and the host.

.. code-block:: bash

   using namespace camp::resources;
   ...
   Cuda d1, d2; //create (specific) Cuda resources, d1 for stream1, d2 for stream2
   Host h1; //create a (specific) Host resource

Then, to allocate memory with your ``ResourceAwarePool`` you can do the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   double* a = static_cast<double*>(pool.allocate(NUM_THREADS * sizeof(double), d1));

Note that there is an extra parameter when using the ``allocate`` function. The second parameter is 
the resource (``d1``) we want the allocated memory to be associated with. In other words, ``d1`` is
the device stream we want to launch the kernel on which will use that memory. 

.. note::
   If allocate is called with no resource, then it will use the default Camp Host resource.

Next, be sure to launch the kernel using the correct stream. 
Since we are using Camp resources, we use ``d1`` that we created above. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   my_kernel<<NUM_BLOCKS, BLOCK_SIZE, 0, d1.get_stream()>>>(a, NUM_THREADS);

The kernel launch specifies the stream from the Cuda resource we created above.
To deallocate, use the following code:

.. code-block:: bash

   pool.deallocate(a, d1);

.. note::
   It can be hard to keep track of which resource corresponds to which pointer. If it is not feasible to keep track
   of that, you can call ``pool.deallocate(ptr)`` as usual. However, this method will call the private ``getResource(ptr)``
   method on the ``ResourceAwarePool`` instance and then call the deallocate method with the correct resource. 
   Because of this overhead, it is recommended to include a resource with the deallocate method if possible.

Assuming you need to reallocate memory on ``a`` with ``d2``, you could then launch a second kernel with the second stream. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   a = static_cast<double*>(pool.allocate(NUM_THREADS * sizeof(double), d2));
   ...
   my_other_kernel<<NUM_BLOCKS, BLOCK_SIZE, 0, d2.get_stream()>>>(a, NUM_THREADS);

Since we are using the ``ResourceAwarePool``, we will not cause a data race from trying to reuse that memory. If the 
memory is still being used by ``d1`` by the time ``d2`` is requesting it, it will be in a ``_``pending``_`` state and thus
not resued by ``d2``. Instead, ``d2`` will be given a different piece of memory.

The ``ResourceAwarePool`` will also be useful for avoiding data races in a situation where host and device
share a single memory space. In the case of a single memory space, just having two or more camp resources, 
whether host or device, will give us the potential for data races since memory can be visible by both host and device.

A full example of using the ``ResourceAwarePool`` can be seen below:
