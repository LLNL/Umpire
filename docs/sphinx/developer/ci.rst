Continuous Integration
======================

Gitlab CI
---------

Umpire uses continuous integration to ensure that changes added to the
repository are well integrated and tested for compatability with the rest
of the existing code base. Our CI tests incude a variety of vetted 
configurations that run on different LC machines.


Umpire shares its Gitlab CI workflow with other projects. The documentation is
therefore `shared <https://radiuss-ci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/uberenv.html#ci>`_.
